Notes on serverless-post-to-slack usage:

To deploy changes to AWS:
    cd to directory
    cmd: sls deploy (or serverless deploy)
    *** Note: This can take a few minutes to finish.

Testing:
    As of 8/30/19, moto has not been fully and properly implemented. So far all that exists is
    a couple of test json payloads to send to the lambda handler function.

    pytest and mock can also be used
